# SimplyIoT
SimplyIoT is an IoT management web application that empowers consumers. Off-the-shelf IoT products discourage users from buying devices outside of their ecosystem. Our application integrates WiFi System on Chip with sensors and switches from multiple manufacturers to offer customers more buying options. 

SimplyIoT includes automation features based on parameters: brightness and humidity, sensors and switches management (GUI), power consumption analysis, and user authentication. Authenticated users can interact with registered peripherals and see the usage history. Admins can add/remove devices and change the analytic dashboard. 

The application is targeting single-family homes, but it can be developed to control multi-family residential homes.
